Disclaimers:
- These are just minor adjustments to existing mods. Always refer to the original mod for new versions.
- They may or may not work for you. Suppor will be limited.
- When possible, I do try to secure permission to post modified version of the mods.
- Please pay attention to version numbers. These patches have been built with a particular version in mind.

## Special Edition conversions

The mods in this repository are designed for Vanilla Skyrim, or Skyrim Legendary Edition (LE).
